With so many models on the market and new designs being introduced all the time, it’s hard to know where to start when choosing a car.
It’s so confusing that many people just buy the same model again — if they liked the last one — ignoring new and better choices. 
Others take recommendations from friends or buy something that catches their eye with sleek design or clever advertising.
There’s a much better way to pick the right car, a practical approach that also allows room for some fun.
Here’s an overview of the process:
Figure out what you need.
Set your budget.
Use a car finder tool to match your needs and budget to the market.
Test drive at least three cars.
Review your research and make a decision.

Buying a stock — especially that first time you become a bona fide part owner of a business — deserves its own celebratory ritual. But before we pick out shareholder party hats and rent a ticker tape confetti cannon, let’s go through the basics of how to buy stocks.

Open a brokerage account
Opening a brokerage account is as easy as setting up a bank account: You complete an account application, provide proof of identification and choose how you want to fund the account. You may fund your account by mailing a check or transferring funds electronically.

So how do you find a broker that’s worthy of your dough? It’s not just about finding the one with the cheapest trading commissions. Paying a few bucks more per trade at a brokerage that provides high-quality customer service is worth it, especially at the start of your investing journey.
